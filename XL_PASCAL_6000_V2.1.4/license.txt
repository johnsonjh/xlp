  AIX XL Pascal Compiler/6000
  Version 2 Release 1
  Program Number 5765-245
 
 
  PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
  ___________________
 
  The IBM* AIX* XL Pascal Compiler/6000 Version 2.1 is a licensed
  program product designed to offer a productive application develop-
  ment environment for Pascal application developers.  It is a
  follow-on version of the AIX XL Pascal Compiler/6000 Version 1.1
  program product (5601-254).
 
  The AIX XL Pascal Compiler/6000 licensed program product includes
  the function of the XL Pascal runtime component.  Applications
  developed using the AIX XL Pascal Compiler/6000 must be bound with
  the XL Pascal runtime component for execution.  The runtime compo-
  nent may be bound using dynamic binding which requires that the XL
  Pascal runtime component be available at the time the application
  is executed.  Alternatively, the runtime component may be stat-
  ically bound to the application resulting in a larger object
  module, but eliminating the requirement for the XL Pascal runtime
  component in the execution environment.
 
  The XL Pascal runtime component library routines include support
  for the following types of functions that may be invoked by an XL
  Pascal program:
 
  o   Text file data transformations between the character form found
      in text files and the internal data formats
  o   Data file access and support functions
  o   String manipulation functions
 
  AIX XL PASCAL COMPILER/6000:  The XL Pascal compiler offers the
  following features:
 
  o   Improved execution performance
 
  o   Enhanced optimization level -O3
 
  o   POWER, POWER2*, and PowerPC* RISC System/6000 architectures are
      fully exploited
 
  o   Optional support for 4-byte Pascal POINTER data type
 
  INTERLANGUAGE CALLS:  Interlanguage calls allow Pascal programs
  written using XL Pascal to communicate with programs written in XL
  C/6000 and XL Fortran Compiler/6000, C Set++ for AIX Version 2 and
  C Set++ for AIX Version 3.
 
  AIX TOOLS SUPPORT

  o   DBX symbolic debug program
  o   PROF and GPROF profilers

  MACHINE-READABLE DOCUMENTATION
  ______________________________
  The following general terms and conditions apply to customer use
  and reproduction of the machine-readable documentation provided
  with the AIX Version 3 for RISC System/6000:
 
  o   Displayable versions may be copied and used on:
 
      -   Processors which the AIX Version 3 for RISC System/6000 is
          licensed for use by the customer
 
      -   Any other processor in support of the licensed program (for
          example, for printing hard copy or for reading displayable
          copy).
 
  o   You may not create a derivative work from the documentation.
 
  o   The right is granted to make sufficient hard copies from dis-
      playable versions distributed by IBM to support authorized use
      of the AIX Version 3 for RISC System/6000 by the customer.

      right notice.
 
  o   Resale or distribution of displayable or hard copies is prohib-
      ited.
 
  TESTING PERIOD
  ______________
 
  o   Basic License: Two months.
  o   DSLO License: Not applicable.
 
  INSTALLATION/LOCATION LICENSE
  _____________________________
 
  Not applicable.  A separate license is required for each designated
  machine on which the licensed program materials will be used.  See
  the following section for usage restrictions.
 
  USAGE RESTRICTION
  _________________
  XL Pascal is licensed per user of the program.  It operates under
  the Network Licensing System** (NetLS**).  The new name for this
  technology is Operation and Retrieval Licensing System**
  (iFOR/LS**), and the two terms are interchangeable.  You can choose
  between nodelocked licensing, concurrent-use licensing, or a combi-
  nation of both.  A password or passwords are required for the
  program to operate.
 
  Each user of the licensed program requires a per user feature.  The
  total number of per user features must be equal to or greater than
  the number of users requiring access to the licensed program.  A
  per user feature can be either a nodelocked feature or a
  concurrent-use feature.  To increase the number of users who can
  use the licensed program, nodelocked and/or concurrent-use features
  must be ordered and a new password obtained.
 
  If you choose concurrent-use licensing, XL Pascal will operate
  under control of the iFOR/LS license server.  Concurrent-use
  licenses allow users to access the program product from any machine
  in a network.  The number of concurrent-use users is contained
  within the iFOR/LS password.
 
  If you choose nodelocked licensing, XL Pascal does not require the
  iFOR/LS license server.  The nodelocked licensing option requires
  that each node on which the program product operates has an author-
  ized license for its unique system ID.  When invoked, the program
  product requests a license password containing the license from the
  nodelock license file.  This file contains a list of valid program
  passwords.  The number of nodelocked users is contained within the
  iFOR/LS password.
 
  If you choose both nodelocked and concurrent-use licensing, mul-
  tiple passwords will be issued.
